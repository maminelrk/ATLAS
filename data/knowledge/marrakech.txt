### Marrakech: The Red City

Marrakech is the fourth-largest city in Morocco and one of the four imperial cities. It is often called the "Red City" or "Ochre City" due to the red sandstone walls built by Ali ibn Yusuf in the 12th century.

**Key Attractions:**
* **Jemaa el-Fnaa:** The main square in the Medina, a UNESCO World Heritage Site famous for its storytellers, snake charmers, acrobats, and food stalls, particularly vibrant at night.
* **Koutoubia Mosque:** The largest mosque in Marrakech, distinguished by its famous minaret, which served as the model for the Giralda in Seville.
* **Jardin Majorelle:** A famous 12-acre botanical garden and landscape garden created by French artist Jacques Majorelle and later owned by Yves Saint Laurent. It is known for its intense cobalt blue color, called Majorelle Blue.

**Travel Tips:**
* The city is divided into two main parts: the **Medina** (old, walled city) and the **Gueliz** (new city).
* The primary languages spoken are **Arabic**, **French**, and **Amazigh** (Berber).
* For short trips within the city, use a **Petit Taxi** and insist the driver uses the meter.
