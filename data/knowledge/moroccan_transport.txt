### Public Transportation in Morocco

Public transportation in Morocco is generally efficient, connecting most major cities and tourist destinations.

**Trains (ONCF):**
* **Al Boraq:** Morocco's high-speed rail service, connecting Tangier, Kenitra, Rabat, and Casablanca, operating at up to 320 km/h. It is the first high-speed line in Africa.
* **Al Atlas:** Standard intercity services connecting major cities like Casablanca, Marrakech, Fes, and Oujda.
* **Classes:** First class offers more comfort, air conditioning, and reserved seating. Second class is cheaper and still comfortable for shorter journeys.

**Buses (CTM and Supratours):**
* **CTM and Supratours** are the two most recommended bus companies for long-distance travel, offering high standards of comfort, air conditioning, and reliable schedules.
* Supratours is often used for connecting destinations not served by the ONCF train network, such as **Essaouira** and **Chefchaouen**.

**Taxis:**
* **Petit Taxis:** Small, color-coded cars (e.g., red in Casablanca, yellow in Marrakech) operating *within* city limits only. They use meters but fares should be agreed upon if the meter is not used.
* **Grand Taxis:** Larger, shared vehicles (often old Mercedes sedans) used for intercity travel or between nearby towns. They leave when full (usually six passengers), but a passenger can buy empty seats to leave sooner. Fares are fixed for specific routes.
